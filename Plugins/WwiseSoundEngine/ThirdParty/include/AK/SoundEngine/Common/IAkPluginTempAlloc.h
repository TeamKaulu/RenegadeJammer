/// Interface for performing extremely-fast zero-fragmentation temporary allocations,
/// e.g. allocations that exist for one or two ticks, or allocations that exist for a single stack frame.
/// These use the existing TempAlloc infrastructure in the core soundengine, whose behaviour and allocation
/// characteristics are defined in the MemoryMgr initialization settings.
///
/// For temporary allocations, types and lifetimes can be specified for mallocations -- or reallocs.
/// These allocations will only persist for the given soundengine tick (Lifetime_CurrentTick) and be destroyed
/// at the beginning of the next tick, or will persist for two soundengine ticks.
/// 
/// For bookmark allocations, you need to mark the start of a bookmark-allocation Region and perform allocations 
/// that persist until the bookmark-allocation region is closed. A struct, "PluginBookmarkAllocRegion" has
/// been provided to help with that.
/// 
/// Because these allocations are guaranteed to be destroyed collectively and simultaneously as a part
/// of their respective system, there is no fragmentation incurred by this, and no 'free' function is available.
/// Also, these allocations are also extremely fast, with no multi-threading contention in most cases, and
/// the total overhead of each alloc measured on the order of dozens of cycles.
